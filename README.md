## About Me
I'm passionate about creating a safe and secure Decentralised Society, pushing the boundaries of Racing Quadcopters, and performing innovative Circus acts. 

I'm dedicated to learning and developing decentralised technology to give us more trust and transparency. I'm honing my skills in the world of racing quadcopters with a flight simulator called Lift-Off and I'm also a retired acrobat of 10 years, having performed all over the world with my company Boom Circus Theatre and DuoSu. 

Thanks for taking the time to visit my github profile and learn more about my interests. 

Happy exploring!
