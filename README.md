## About Me
I'm passionate about creating a safe and secure Decentralised Society, pushing the boundaries of Racing Quadcopters, and performing innovative Circus acts. 

I'm dedicated to learning and developing decentralised technology to give us more trust and transparency. I'm honing my skills in the world of racing quadcopters with a flight simulator called Lift-Off and I'm also a retired acrobat of 10 years, having performed all over the world with my company Boom Circus Theatre and DuoSu. 

Thanks for taking the time to visit my github profile and learn more about my interests. 

Happy exploring!

I am proud to announce the release of my latest creation, the Encrypted Ethers Wallet. This tool is designed to make it easier for users to create password-protected JSON wallets for use with the Ethers blockchain. I built this tool with the goal of providing a versatile and secure solution for interacting with the Ethers network, and I hope that others will find it useful. After a lot of hard work and dedication, I am thrilled to finally share this project with the world, and I look forward to seeing how it is put to use.
