## About Me
Driven by the pursuit of technological excellence, I am the Chief Technology Officer at MetaLumna, an expert in deep tech, and an architect of impactful AI and blockchain technology solutions.

There are values that the blockchain technology encapsulates like security, transparency, and efficiency that resonate with me. It offers an extraordinary array of opportunities, and when integrated with AI, it imposes a constructive disruption to the technological space which aligns with my urge towards creative innovation.

Although I've worn many hats, one of the most interesting ones was when I was a professional acrobat! It's this intriguing mix of adaptability, creativity and practical design that I bring to the tech field, giving me a unique edge in this continuously evolving world of deep tech.
